# Making Your Mark

To mark a picture, click and drag the mark around the entire picture, including the caption and cutline if there is any. The cutline is generally a longer prose under the caption, describing the pciture.

After you have the mark around the area you want, click the green "Done" check-box at the bottom-right corner of the mark. 

If you'd like to remove one of your marks, click on it and then on the red x button in the upper-right corner of the mark.
