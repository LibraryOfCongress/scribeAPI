# Making Your Mark

To Mark a picture, click and drag the mark around the entire picture, including the caption and cutline (if present). The cutline is generally a section of longer prose under the caption, further describing the picture. 

Once youâ€™ve marked the area around the picture, click the green box at the bottom right corner. 

Made a mistake? Adjust the edges of the box by clicking and dragging the dot at the corners. 

You can also remove your mark by clicking on it and selecting the red X button on the upper right corner of the mark. Once the box is cleared, you can try again.
