# Describe the Picture

Most pictures have captions and/or descriptions. Enter the text exactly as you see it, including the capitalization and punctuation. However remove hyphenation that breaks words at the end of line. Use new lines to separate different parts of captions and descriptions.

You may omit any text that for any reason is difficult to decipher. But keep in mind that you can zoom in or view the original high resolution images to get a better look.
