#Transcribe

Transcribe the text exactly as you see it. For additional help, each transcription prompt has an "Need help?" button providing field specific context.

If the text is hard to read, give it your best shot and keep going. Keep in mind: each mark will be transcribed by multiple volunteers and quality controlled in the Verify task.

If the field is indecipherable, click "Illegible?" button and then "Save" button to move on to the next entry. If the marked area contains no picture, click "Bad region?" button and then "Save" button.
