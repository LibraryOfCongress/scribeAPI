#Transcribe

Transcribe the text exactly as you see it. For additional help, each transcription prompt has an "Need help?" button providing field specific context.

If the text is hard to read, give it your best shot and keep going. You may surround the words you are not sure with square brackets [ ].

If the marked area contains no picture or only partial picture, click "Bad region?" button and then "Save" button.
