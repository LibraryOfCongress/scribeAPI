# Existing Marks

You may see existing marks on the page. If this is the case, someone has already marked the pictures and there's no need to mark them twice. Sometimes, you might see that others have left bad marks, ex. marks around the wrong area. Ignore any bad marks you see. They will be weeded out in the Transcribe task.  

You can manipulate the digitized pages with tools on the left side of the screen. Here you'll find the zoom tool and a mark toggle. The mark toggle allows you to hide other people's marks from the page.
