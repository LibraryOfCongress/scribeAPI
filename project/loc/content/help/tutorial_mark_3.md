# Existing Marks

You may see existing marks on the page. If this is the case, someone has already marked the pictures and there's no need to mark them twice. If there is nothing left to mark, click the "Done" button. 

Sometimes, you might see that others have left bad marks. Ignore any bad marks you see. They will be weeded out in the Transcribe task.  

The mark toggle on the left side of the screen allows you to hide other people's marks from the page.
