# Mark

In the Mark step, your task is to identify and select pictures in newspaper pages. For our project, “pictures” means illustrations, photographs, comics, and cartoons. You'll use the marking tool to draw a box around the picture using your mouse. 

After you have marked all pictures on the newspaper page, click the DONE button. Skip the page altogether by clicking the Skip this page button.

If no illustrations, photographs, or cartoons appear on the page, click the DONE button.

Not sure if a picture should be marked? Select the “Done for now, more left to mark” button so another volunteer can help finish that page. 

Please do not select pictures within advertisements.
