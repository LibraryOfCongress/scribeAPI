# Task
Your task is to identify and mark pictures such as illustrations and photographs in newspaper pages. Please do not include pictures within an advertisement. 

After you have marked all the pictures in a newspaper page, click the "Done" button.

You do not have to mark the pictures all at one time. However it helps us a lot if you tell us there is still umarked picture by clicking "More Left to Mark" button.

You can skip the page altogether by clicking "Skip This Page" button.
