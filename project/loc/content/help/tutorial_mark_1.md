# Task
Your task is to identify pictures such as illustrations and photographs in newspaper pages. Please do not include pictures within an advertisement. 

After you have identified and marked all the pictures in a newspaper page, click the "Done" button.

You do not have to mark all the pictures at one fell swoop. However it will help us a lot if you tell us there is still umarked picture by clicking "More picture to mark" button.
