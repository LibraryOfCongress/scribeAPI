## A Brief Introduction

### Our Goal

This project from LC Labs experiments with crowdsourcing, discovering and describing information in historic newspapers.

[More backgroud about this project]

To divide the labor -- and to help ensure accuracy -- we've broken the work into 3 free-standing tasks. These tasks follow a sequence, but they can be performed independently (feel free to focus on the one you enjoy best).

### Task 1: Mark

Here you'll be identifying various types of pictures (illustrations and photographs) in the newspapers. You won't be typing, just drawing boxes. You may see existing marks left by other users. Just pick up where they left off. Do not identify pictures within an advertisement.

### Task 2: Transcribe

You'll enter the text inside the fields marked by your fellow volunteers. Some fields are prepopulated with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) text. Although OCR technologies have been improved significantly in recent years, from time to time you may find OCR text inaccurate and need to be corrected. Sometimes text in the newspapers is difficult to read. You can zoom in/out (Control Alt +/-) and pan (Control Alt arrow keys) or even view the full-resolution newspaper page via the "View the original page" link on the right panel. If you still find it hard to decipher, don't worry, we'll get these transcribed multiple times to ensure accuracy, so give it your best shot and move on.

### Task 3: Verify

Every newspaper page will be transcribed several times by multiple volunteers, and our software looks for agreement among them. If a field has been transcribed consistently and independently multiple times, it has reached "consensus" and is added to the final data set. If there are conflicting entries, those are queued up in the Verify task, where you can vote on the most accurate transcription, or, if needed, add your own.
