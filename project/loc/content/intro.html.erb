### Our Goals

The Library of Congress invites you to help us in the effort to take newspapers <i>Beyond Words</i>. Join us to identify and improve information about illustrated newspapers in the Chronicling America digital collection. This brand new pilot project offers you the opportunity to explore historical newspaper coverage of World War I and contribute to Library of Congress collections at the same time. 

This project from [LC Labs](https://labs.loc.gov) is an experiment in crowdsourcing and community engagement. Our goals are to gather more structured and usable metadata about the illustrations, comics, cartoons, and photographs in these newspapers; and to learn how to better connect to people who are interested in our collections.

To help us reach our goal -- and to help ensure accuracy -- we've broken the work into 3 free-standing tasks. These tasks follow a sequence, but they can be performed independently. Feel free to focus on the one you enjoy the most!

The information that is created through this project is being made available for download as [data sets](/#/data) and for exploration via keyword search in the [Gallery](/#/gallery).

### Task 1: Mark

Here you'll be identifying various types of pictures (illustrations, photographs, and cartoons) in the newspapers. You won't be typing, just drawing boxes. You may see existing marks left by other users. Just pick up where they left off. Do not identify pictures within an advertisement.

### Task 2: Transcribe

You'll enter the text inside the fields marked by your fellow volunteers. Each transcribe window has 3 fields: Caption, Artist, and Category. 

The Caption field is the place to transcribe the title, caption, and cutline of the picture. Some caption fields may be prepopulated with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) text. From time to time you may find OCR text inaccurate and need to be corrected. You can also delete the OCR text and transcribe the caption. Enter the text exactly as you see it. Include capitalization and punctuation, but remove hyphenation that breaks words at the end of the line. Use new lines to separate different parts of captions and descriptions. 

The Artist field is where you will enter the illustrator, photographer, cartoonist, or artist name – if present on the picture. Please enter as written. You’ll use the Category field to tell us what kind of picture is being transcribed: Editorial Cartoon, Comics/Cartoon, Illustration, Photograph, or Map. 

Sometimes you may find the text too small to read. You can zoom using the controls in the upper left corner of the screen; you can also zoom with keyboard commands: (<kbd>Control</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd>) and pan using: (<kbd>Control</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>/<kbd>&larr;</kbd>/<kbd>&darr;</kbd>/<kbd>&rarr;</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>W</kbd>/<kbd>A</kbd>/<kbd>S</kbd>/<kbd>D</kbd>). It may also be helpful to view the full-resolution newspaper page via the "View the original page" link on the right panel. If you still find it hard to decipher, don't worry. Together we’ll transcribe these pages several times to ensure accuracy, so give it your best shot and move on.

### Task 3: Verify

Every newspaper page will be transcribed several times by multiple volunteers, and our software looks for agreement among them. If a field has been transcribed consistently and independently multiple times, it has reached "consensus" and is added to the final data sets. 

However, conflicting transcriptions are queued up in the Verify task. Here’s where we need your help: you can select the most accurate transcription. If none of the options appear correct, you can also add your own.

### Ready?

Try the following tasks!

<div class="columns">
  <ul>
    <li><a class="major-button" href="/#/mark">Mark</a> Locate illustrations, photographs, and cartoons on newspaper pages. Please do not include those in advertisements.</li>
    <li><a class="major-button" href="/#/transcribe">Transcribe</a> Type the titles, captions, and cutlines of the pictures marked by fellow volunteers. Correct inaccurate OCR text or add missing details.</li>
    <li><a class="major-button" href="/#/verify">Verify</a> Sometimes transcribers disagree. Help arbitrate and ensure that the highest quality data is produced.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Helpful hints
<ul>
<li>You may want to try Beyond Words using a mouse and keyboard. The mouse will help you target the marks and transcription. </li> 
<li>We’re seeking agreement in transcription, so each page is transcribed more than once. If transcriptions don’t match, the verify step allows you to help select the best transcription. After we reach consensus, the transcribe text is searchable in the Gallery.</li>
<li>Remember, this is an experiment! We ask that you send us your feedback and questions at [ndi@loc.gov](mailto:ndi@loc.gov).</li>
<li>Need to zoom or move around the page? You can use the navigation tool at the top left of the screen, or you can use the keyboard.</li>
</ul>

The newspapers that you see in this project are shared by [Chronicling America](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov), a partnership between Library of Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities and state partners. Chronicling America provides access to a collection of millions of historic newspapers.
